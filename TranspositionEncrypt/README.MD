# TranspositionEncryption

It's a good kind of cipher which using the message characters without changing it,
And just change it's place in the sentence so the message come out without any meaning at all,
All of that come with the Encryption Key, which is definde the number of boxes that will change the characters in it.
Have Fun with It ;)
